## Study data
Data were obtained using the photoplethysmography (PPG) reflection method, recording signals from the forehead, ear, and index finger of 23 subjects.

## Description of Subjects
The signals of 23 subjects (11 women and 12 men) ranging in age from 21 to 72 years, respectively, were analyzed. Additionally, notes regarding subject characteristics (age, gender, blood glucose level) In addition, information was collected on whether they had been diagnosed with diabetes and to which type of diabetic they belong, in the MSExcel file, "Characteristics_Glucose_Subjects.xlsx" the information related to each topic is summarized as follows:

·Subject: Name of the record associated with each individual, 'Subj_##" (where ## is each subject's number).

·Age: a range of age ranging from 21 years old to a maximum of 72 years old 

·Gender: Male or Female, "M" if male and "F" female 

·Diabetic: Yes, for the one who is diabetic and not, for the one who is not 

·Type of diabetes: Diabetic, Prediabetic and Not applicable 

## Importance of PPG in glucose control.
Postprandial glucose (PPG) refers to the increase in blood sugar levels after food intake and is a key indicator of glycemic control in people with and without diabetes. In healthy individuals, PPG is kept within a physiological range thanks to the rapid action of insulin, which facilitates the uptake of glucose by the tissues. However, in people with insulin resistance or diabetes, this mechanism is altered, leading to higher and sustained glucose spikes over time. Studies have shown that elevated PPG levels, especially above 180 mg/dL two hours after eating, are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular complications and microvascular damage. Therefore, monitoring and controlling PPG, through dietary adjustments, exercise, and pharmacological therapies, is essential to prevent the progression of metabolic diseases and reduce the risk of associated complications (American Diabetes Association, 2022).
