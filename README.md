## Blood glucose
Glucose is a 6-carbon structure with the chemical formula C6H12O6. Carbohydrates are ubiquitous energy sources for all organisms in the world and are essential for fueling aerobic and anaerobic cellular respiration in simple and complex molecular forms [1]. Therefore, their role in energy production and their importance for various daily bodily functions are crucial for maintaining healthy blood glucose levels.

Although the body requires moderate amounts of glucose, the presence of excessively high (hyperglycemia) or low (hypoglycemia) levels in the blood can significantly increase the risk of serious health complications, leading to a life-threatening disorder called diabetic coma that causes loss of consciousness. [2]

Normal levels for people with and without diabetes are presented below:

**Normal Values ​​For People Without Diabetes**



| ** Before Eating** | ** 2H After Eating**  | 
|-------------|:--------:|
| 70- 110 mg/dL  | Menos de 140 mg/dL        | 

**Normal values ​​for people with diabetes**

| ** Before Eating** | ** 2H After Eating**  | 
|-------------|:--------:|
| 80- 130 mg/dL  | Menos de 180 mg/dL        |
